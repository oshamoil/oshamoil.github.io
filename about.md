Hi there, my name is Omid. I'm currently pursuing my Masters degree in Computer
Science at Seattle University, and getting my hands on all things software development
in the meantime, whether that be at school, work, or my free time.

I'm currently a Data Engineer at Mazda North
American Operations building tools and data pipelines to support the anaysts
and data scientists on the data science team. 

I'm a first-generation Iranian-American based in Seattle, but originally from Los Angeles, CA.
My passion and growing curiosity for computer science and software development
happened at a point during my career working in the data world. The feeling
of incrementally building and refining something gives me an indescribable
rush of dopamine. But I knew this field for me when a professor of mine described
this field as a craft, and that we are craftsmen. He instilled in us that how far
we go in mastering and refining this craft is **completely** in our hands, and
from that moment I knew I was hooked.

My technical interests typically revolve around things I am currently
itching to learn more about, and right now those are: distributed systems,
language construction, all things API, and containers. 
My non-technical interests involve my unhealthy obsession with the Los Angeles Lakers,
cooking Persian food, and learning how to identify flowers (specifically in my neighborhood)
